// English content pages, expressed as data. See lib/doc.ts for why.
//
// Only pages added since the DocPage renderer landed live here. The original
// hand-built pages (index, roadmap, transparency, contribute) keep their own
// templates; they can move into this file one at a time if that ever looks
// worth doing.
//
// The install page states what works TODAY. Prebuilt binaries, the shell
// installer and a working Homebrew formula all arrive with M6 (release
// engineering), which has not shipped: the tap currently holds a generated
// placeholder and v0.1.0 carries no attached binaries. Listing those as if
// they worked would be the exact failure this site exists to prevent — a page
// that says one thing while the repositories say another.
